# Gibson MPI_Experiment

No additional libraries outside of python's default libraries are required.

To run the MPI simulation simply run as a script with 'python mpi_simulator.py'
To run the unit test for the collatz sequence function run 'python collatz_test.py'

The mpi_simulator is not unit tested as it writes to a file and does not return anything on its own.
